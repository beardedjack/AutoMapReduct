reduction of automaton mappings

For finite deterministic automata with a given number of states, with the input and output alphabets {0,1,2, ... m-1}, m-natural, it is necessary to build the reduction graph automaton mappings associated with these machines. At the same time, highlight in this class of automaton mappings: measure-preserving measure-preserving ergodic +, ergodic.
